We spend all our working days writing WordPress themes and plugins, using modern PHP development techniques, and taking cues from frameworks like Laravel, Symphony 2, and Slim. Messy, unmaintainable, legacy code is the last thing you'll find in our software."

We write ES6 transpiled and linted with WebPack, using industry best practices. When we're not writing PHP, we're often writing vanilla JS for legacy projects, Backbone applications, and most recently, using React and Redux."
